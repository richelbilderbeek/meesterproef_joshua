#Comparing two epitope prediction programs

* Joshua van Waardenberg
 
## Introduction

We will use the R packages MHCNuggets and EpitopePrediction to predict the ic50 values (....)

## Hypothesis

We expect MHCNuggets and EpitopePredictions to predict around the same values. And that when the values relative to the other predictions are compared that we get a graph with a straight line through the line y = x.

## Methods

We use the R programming language in RStudio, with the libraries MHCNuggets and EpitopePrediction.

## Results

The results of MHCNuggets are completely different from the EpitopePrediction results.

## Conclusion

At least one of the libraries is wrong.

## Discussion

MHCNuggets predicts the values using tensorflow, EpitopePrediction uses (....). One of these methods is less precise.
